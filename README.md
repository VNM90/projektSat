Hi, here is my issue:
I could not return data from promise it is all the time on pending and when I try to return variable and invoke function to use that data/variable it is showing me undefined. Without that I cannot use loops and if statments to work on database(or maybe I just do not know).

I am not really proud what I have done but something is better than nothing.:)

Thank you for your time.
